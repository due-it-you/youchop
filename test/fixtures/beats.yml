# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one:

  user: one
  created_at: <%= Time.now %>
  updated_at: <%= Time.now %>
# column: value
#
two:
  title: "beat2"
  user: two
  created_at: <%= Time.now %>
  updated_at: <%= Time.now %>
# column: value
